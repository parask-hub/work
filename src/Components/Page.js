          Each one of our adventures has an activity level ranging from 1 to 5.
          Level 1 trips are the easiest, Level 3 trips are moderate, and Level 5
          trips are considered our most strenuous trips—our ultimate challenges.
          We recommend taking into account the activity level and reading the
          activity overview for your chosen itinerary to fully prepare for your
          adventure. Read more about each activity level below.

            up to 3 hours at elevations below 6,000 feet, sea kayaking in
            protected waters, or river rafting on Class I-II rapids.
